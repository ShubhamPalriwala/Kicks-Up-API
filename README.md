# Kicks-Up-API

Here, I've created a Backend for an e-commerce website as my Web Dev project for ISOC 2020 by IEEE VIT.

Clone this repository and run 'npm install' to grab all the necessary packages.
Create a folder in your local device named for example mongodb-data
Make sure to load it in place of --dbpath given below

For example, for me this looks like:
Run the following in a separate command window:
/Users/Sanjay/mongodb/bin/mongod --dbpath=/Users/Sanjay/mongodb-data

The database will be running now
Now in a separate command window run 'npm start'

The Backend is running now..
Use Postman to try all the requests.
